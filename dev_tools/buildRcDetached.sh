# Why detached: a build started from an agent session dies with "context canceled"
# when the session recycles mid-build. setsid + a stable log file survives that.
#
# Why a cached build rather than buildImage.sh's --no-cache + system prune: the
# COPY layers invalidate on the changed files anyway, and the real check is
# verifying the markers INSIDE the pushed image (done at the end here), not
# trusting the build flags. It is also far less disk I/O on this host.
